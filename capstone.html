										<h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
									</header>
									<p>Generalization, the process that selecting and simplifying proper spatial data to preserve map readable from a large scale to a small scale, has been a critical problem in cartography for decades. The main reason is that some generalization rules need to judge by context which is easy to understand for humans but hard to formalized or measurable for models. Therefore, for existing tools, that causes difficulty to adapt to the general situation and limitation to the specific environment, such as in a space that contains rural and urban. The past solutions usually used different algorithms or parameters, but they still exist some problems, which contain it is hard to define which area belongs to urban or rural, or correctly connect them on the boundaries of separation. Recently, deep learning, which uses multiple non-linear levels to realize the human-like judgment model, has successfully applied in different fields was regarded as a better solution to overcome the problem in generalization spaces in both contain rural and urban. This research uses deep learning to provide a generally useful building generalization technique for both urban and rural. This model used the U-Net architecture and the 25,000 scales, 100,000 scales, and 250,000 scales map as the training data. Using 25,000 scales map to generate 100,000 scales and 250,000 generalized maps. The first generalization is mostly based on rules in the same dimensionality, such as merge, simplify, and smooth, and the second involves rules contain the conversion in different dimensionalities, such as collapse and aggregate. The research successfully indicates deep learning can provide a better result in generalizing the building in urban and rural areas.</p>
